* Units
  A program to convert between units of measurement
  On Twitter, I hang with many people from the US. They are good people, but
  they use a system of measurement that is just repulsive, unlike the metric
  system.
  More importantly, it is something I'm not used to. When a US citizen says
  it's 70 degrees outside, I have no clue what that means. In degrees Celsius,
  70 degrees is very hot, approaching the boiling point of water.
  So I want a program that I can enter some magnitude into and have it
  converted back and forth into something I can understand. Both ways.
  I am still not 100% sure if I want a GUI application or a web app?

  [2022-12-22 Do 19:51] - I will try a web app first, for all the right
  reasons.
